<p><a href="https://blog.kasten.io/devops-learning-curve">So you want to learn DevOps?</a></p>
<h2 id="let-the-journey-begin">Let the journey begin</h2>
<p>I will share at this point that everyone should have a good look at and maybe create your own mind map for yourself and your interest and position is the following: </p>
<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">DevOps Roadmap</a></p>
<h2 id="first-steps-what-is-devops">First Steps - What is DevOps?</h2>
<p>There are so many blog articles and YouTube videos to list here, but as we start this journey we will focus on spending each topic a day learning something new or about DevOps. We will start with some of the high level of "what DevOps is" down to start off this week. </p>
<p>Firstly, DevOps is not a tool. You cannot buy it, it is not a software sku or an open source GitHub repository you can download. It is also not a programming language, it is also not some dark art magic either. </p>
<p>DevOps is a way to do smarter things in Software Development. DevOps brings together a combination of software development and operations. There are people with all different backgrounds where DevOps is 100% going to benefit the individual, Developers, Operations and QA Engineers all can equally learn these best practices by having a better understanding of DevOps. </p>
<p>DevOps is a set of practices that help to reach the goal of this movement: reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever it could be an internal team or customer. </p>
<p>Another area we will dive into in this first week is around <strong>The Agile Methodology</strong> DevOps and Agile are widely adopted together to achieve continuous delivery of your <strong>Application</strong> </p>
<p>The high level take away is with a DevOps mindset or culture its about taking a way the long drawn out software release process from potentially years to being able to drop smaller releases more frequently. The other key fundamental to take away here is it's about breaking down silos between the teams I previously mentioned, Developers, Operations and QA. </p>
<p>From a DevOps perspective, <strong>Development, Testing and Deployment</strong> all land with the DevOps team. </p>
<p>The final point I will make is to make this as effective and efficient as possible we must leverage <strong>Automation</strong> </p>
